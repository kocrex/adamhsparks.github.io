I am a botanical epidemiologist and ecologist specialising in multivariate
statistics, network analysis, geographic information systems (GIS) and
simulation modeling. Currently I lead the summer crops pathology theme in the
[Centre for Crop Health]("https://www.usq.edu.au/research/research-at-usq/institutes-centres/cch")
at the [University of Southern Queensland]("https://www.usq.edu.au")
researching integrated disease management of broadacre crops.
